"""
gRPC retry interceptor for SDK service calls.

Wraps every outgoing gRPC call from a service client (`SessionClient`,
`ModelClient`, `WorkflowClient`, …) with exponential-backoff retries on a
small set of codes that indicate transient infrastructure trouble.

Retryable codes:
- UNAVAILABLE        — server unreachable / not yet ready
- DEADLINE_EXCEEDED  — call timed out before completing
- RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED — server-side rate limit or load shedding

Anything else (INVALID_ARGUMENT, NOT_FOUND, PERMISSION_DENIED, …) propagates
immediately. The retry layer is for transient infra blips, not for hiding
business-logic errors.

This is a *different layer* from the Model Service's internal retry to
external providers: that one handles failures between Model
Service and OpenAI/Anthropic; this one handles failures between any SDK
client and the platform's gateway.
